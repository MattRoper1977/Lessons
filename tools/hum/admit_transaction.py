"""ORDER HUM-T · declare this batch's transplanted decks as a GLV3 replacement transaction.

_glv3/tools/verify_change_boundary.py protects the whole `Humanities_Teesside`
prefix. A modification to a lesson deck matches none of its admitted cases and
falls through to the fence:

    original GLV3 protected-path fence rejected: <deck>

The designed admission is a declared replacement transaction, GLV3's equivalent
of CATALOGUE_PINS, which `replacement_errors` then judges member by member:
exactly the declared set and no more, status M, the previous blob identity read
from the real merge base, exact bytes on disk, and a matching CATALOGUE_PINS
admission. This tool declares; it never judges, and it never widens the fence.

ONE TRANSACTION PER BRANCH, NOT ONE FOR THE ORDER. `replacement_errors` requires
the CHANGED set to equal the DECLARED set, so a declaration naming every deck of
the order could never be satisfied on any single batch branch. Declaration order
is review order and a later declaration supersedes an earlier claim on the same
path, so the batches accumulate on main without colliding.

Every value is DERIVED. `beforeGitBlob` comes from `git ls-tree` at the real
merge base with the base ref, `afterSha256` and `bytes` from the bytes on disk,
and the pin from the CATALOGUE_PINS the deck already carries. Nothing is typed.

Refusals:
  - a deck outside the landable set tools/hum/evidence_limb_census.py measures.
    That set is the two digest fences, not a preference: a deck the re-stamp tool
    refuses, or one the David cover pack pins by route, is never declared here.
  - a deck with no CATALOGUE_PINS admission, or whose pin disagrees with its bytes
  - a change whose status is not M
  - a member whose bytes are unreadable, or which is not a regular file
